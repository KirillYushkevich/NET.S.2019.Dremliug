1. `Insert bits.`
    - Implement the **InsertNumber** algorithm for inserting bits from the *j-th* to the *i-th* bit of one number into another so that the bits of the second number take positions from bit j to bit i (bits are numbered from right to left).

2. `FindNextBiggerNumber.`
    - Implement the **FindNextBiggerNumber** method, which takes a *positive integer* and returns *the closest largest integer* consisting of the *digits of the source number*; - 1 if no such number exists.

3.  `Time elapsed for FindNextBiggerNumber.`
    - Add to the **FindNextBiggerNumber** method the ability to return the *time spent* on finding the number.

4. `Filter by a digit.`
    - Implement the **FilterDigit** method, which takes a list of integers and filters the list so that only numbers containing the *specified digit* are left.

5. `FindNthRoot.`
    - Implement the **FindNthRoot** algorithm, which calculates the *n-th root* of a *number* by the Newton method with a given *accuracy*.
