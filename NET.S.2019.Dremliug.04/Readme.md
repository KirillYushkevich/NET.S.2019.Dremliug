1. `Greatest common divisor.`
      - Create a class that allows you to perform GCD calculations using the [*Euclidean algorithm*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) for two or more integers.
      - Add to the created class methods that implement the [*Stein algorithm*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm) (binary Euclidean algorithm).
      - Class methods in addition to calculating the GCD should measure the *time required to perform the calculation*.

2. `Binary representation of double.`
      - Implement an extension method to get a *string binary representation* of a real double-precision number in IEEE 754 format (it is desirable not to use ready-made converter classes).
