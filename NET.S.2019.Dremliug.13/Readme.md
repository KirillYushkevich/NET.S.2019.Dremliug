1. `Generic Queue`.
    - Create a generic Queue class that provides the basic operations of the Queue data structure.
    - Define an iterator over the collection without using *yield* keyword.
    - Add unit-tests.

2. `Generic Matrixes`: Square, Symmetric, Diagonal.
    - Create a generic classes that represent Square, Symmetric and Diagonal matrixes.
    - Add an Event which is raised when any matrix element was changed.
    - Extend functionality of class system with a facility to find a Sum of two matrixes. 
    - Add unit tests.

3. `Generic Binary Search Tree`.
    - Create a generic Binary Search Tree class.
    - Provide an interface for using custom sort order.
    - Implement three ways for traversing the tree: Inorder, Preorder and Postorder. Use *yield* keyword to define an iterator.
    - Test with the following types:
      - System.Int32 (default and custom comparers),
      - System.String (default and custom comparers),
      - custom class Book with a defined sort order for its instances (default and custom comparers),
      - custom struct Point without a defined sort order for its instances (custom comparer).
